# Database Models

This directory contains SQLAlchemy database models.

Models will be created as we build features:
- Account models (for broker accounts)
- Position models (for trades)
- Transaction models (for payin/payout)
- Portfolio snapshot models
- AI recommendation models
- User preference models

Each model will be a separate file and imported in `__init__.py`.
